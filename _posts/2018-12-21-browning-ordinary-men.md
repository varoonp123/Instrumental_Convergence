I first heard of this book, strangely enough, through an online lecture by Jordan Peterson. During the summer of 2018, I was asking myself questions about the role of political leaders and the extent to which they do/should reflect the population. 
- The idea that leaders ought to reflect the desires of their constituents is almost axiomatic to most Americans. To what extent does this idea remain valid if a leader disagrees with his/her constituents? To what extent should leaders shape the psyche of the nation? 
- Setting aside the main architects of atrocities, how does a large subset of the population bring itself to carry out the orders of madmen? It seems that there would need to be problems worth identifying at every level of society. 
- How can we prevent such devolution at the levels of individuals, communities, nations, and global community? 

Maybe civilizations fall when an uncomfortably large number of individuals becomes agents of its destruction. It seems plausible that guarding against the worst tendencies of humanity will always be a duty of the citizenry. Those tendencies certainly include hatred, envy, and jealosy, but they also include an excessive desire to impress others, a false sense of honor or pride, and an unquestioned submission to authority. 

Notably, this book is not an attempt to psychoanalyze one of maybe 100-1000 commited idealogues with influence. That is the job of many college seniors who decide to read _Mein Kampf_ while high. Rather, _Ordinary Men_ tries to shed light on why millions others enabled the vision of a minority. 

_Ordinary Men_ follows a single battalion of about 500 men during the occupation of Poland. They were part of the Order Police, which is separate from the main army. They were tasked, among other things, with making parts of Poland _judenfrei_. In total, these men killed at least 83,000 jews. 

Most of the the book uses the testimonies of about 125 men during interrogations conducted in the 1960's. Care must be taken when reading these because memories fade, people suppress certain thoughts, and soldiers may care to exculpate themselves and comrades. Browning also uses soldiers' personal correspondances sent during the war, along with ample Nazi government records. 

My takeaway of the book is as follows: Idealogical exremism tautologically represents a small fringe and winning over hearts and minds by the tens of millions is immensely difficult. Those who wish  included 
One minor critique of the book is that there are so many names and ranks to keep track of that many individuals blur together. New soldiers are introduced even at the end of the book. This is complicated by the fact that some people enter and leave the battalion. I recommend keeping track of the consequential people in a notebook and not getting bogged down in the minutia. 


The book mostly tracks the progression from the formation of the battalion,

title: Counterfactuals in Economic History
category: paper

I enjoyed ![this](https://vita.mcafee.cc/PDF/VoyageofColumbus.pdf) paper by Preston McAfee on so many levels. McAfee responds to an argument by the late economic historian Robert Fogel that the railroads were not as critical to the development of the U.S. as historians have claimed. In arguing this, Fogel estimated things such as the the value of time lost in water transportation, cargo loss, and "social savings" of the railroads (whatever that means). Ultimately, Fogel estimates that the "social saving" attributable to the railroads is approximately 1% of national income. Basically, the type of counterfactual analysis of Fogel allows for so much subjectivity as to .... Also if one is interested on the effects of trains/infrastructure spending on some battery of economic indicators, there are FAR better sources at the disposal of any economist, though I am not sure that was the case in the 1960's when

> It would be interesting to know if this is true in general. That is, is it the case that, for all $\epsilon > 0$, a $\delta > 0$ exists so that, if history is perturbed by less than $\delta$, then America is perturbed by less than $\epsilon$? In this case, America would be continuous, and hence integrable. One might then wonder if the United States converges in probability to what it will be, as time diverges. 

> Critics of counterfactuals have charged that, given the inability to forecast the U.S. economy even months in advance, and the dearth of all but the most coarse data on historical events, it is absurd to expect to reconstruct how th economy would have been if it were different. There are three avenues of response to this...First, the inability to forecast the modern economy is irrelevent, for the economy was simpler in the old days. Second, if the data are coarse, one can use the coarse topology to analyze them. Thus, no theoretical impediments exist to applying counterfactuals, although it is interesting to suppose they did. 

In Fogel's defense, he is rather cautious about the limitations of his work, but that is drowned out by the rest of the 40 pages of dubious guess work. About 10 years after McAfee published his response, Fogel won the Nobel Prize in Economics "for having renewed research in economic history by applying economic theory and quantitative methods in order to explain economic and institutional change."

To summarize my takeaways:

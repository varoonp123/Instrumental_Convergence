Inspired by the surprisingly interesting social experiment known as [Twitch Plays Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon), we made Twitch chat-controlled cars that could play two games. Throw in some computer vision, Arduino, etc. and you get this monstrosity. [![Github repo](assets/images/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)](https://github.com/cdsupina/MHacks2016)

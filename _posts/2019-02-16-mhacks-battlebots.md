Inspired by the surprisingly interesting social experiment known as [Twitch Plays Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon), we made Twitch chat-controlled cars that could play two games. Throw in some computer vision, Arduino, etc. and you get this monstrosity. [Github repo](https://github.com/cdsupina/MHacks2016). My hackathon projects are on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/pazhyanurv?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav).

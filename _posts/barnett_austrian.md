title: Austrian Economics and Dimensional Analysis
category: paper
---
[This](https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/qjae7_1_10.pdf) paper published by William Barnett II in the Spring 2004 edition of the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics  consists of a handful of (in my opinion) invalid arguments regarding dimensional analysis in economic analysis, and one semi-valid one. 50% of the paper is dedicated to grown men arguing about freshman physics. Here is a flavor:

> This example brings to mind the term idiot savant. No doubt, this referee knows a great deal of pure mathematics; but, does he know anything at all about applied mathematics or physics? On the evidence he provides in the foregoing excerpt, the answer, at least with respect to harmonic motion, is a resounding, â€œNO!

Don't think that the referees took the punishment without fighting back.

> A great deal more effort into communicating the results is going to be necessary, I suspect, to sell this work to any journal. You could try Economics & Philosophy.

Zing! Get these guys microphones and a poorly lit stage with a brick wall.

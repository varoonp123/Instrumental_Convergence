    <h1>Book Reviews</h1>

<p>
  This page contains my thoughts on various books that I found particularly stimulating. In general, they will be 15-30 minute reads.

        <h3><a href="/bookreview/2019/01/05/gordon-growth.html">The Rise and Fall of American Growth</a> by Robert Gordon</h3>
        <p><p>Most high school U.S. history courses focus on what I consider to be the most dull aspects of the subject. While an understanding of major political forces, wars, and social movements is invaluable in understanding the American story, focusing on these aspects can send the message that history is driven by individuals, rather than institutions that while certainly constructed by individuals, operate as forms of distributed intelligence. An equally valid lens through which one can (and should) understand American history is as a march of of science and technology that shape the lives of individuals via markets. Focusing on a period of American history that is approachable and relavent illustrates this utility of this perspective. This book synthesizes Professor Gordon’s research throughout much of his career, starting from his time in graduate school and the thoroughness sings off of the pages.</p>

        <h3><a href="/bookreview/2018/12/21/browning-ordinary-men.html">Ordinary Men</a> by Christopher Browning</h3>
        <p><p>I first heard of this book, strangely enough, through an online lecture by Jordan Peterson. During the summer of 2018, I was asking myself questions about the role of political leaders and the extent to which they do/should reflect the population.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The idea that leaders ought to reflect the desires of their constituents is almost axiomatic to most Americans. To what extent does this idea remain valid if a leader disagrees with his/her constituents? To what extent should leaders shape the psyche of the nation?</li>
  <li>Setting aside the main architects of atrocities, how does a large subset of the population bring itself to carry out the orders of madmen? It seems that there would need to be problems worth identifying at every level of society.</li>
  <li>How can we prevent such devolution at the levels of individuals, communities, nations, and global community?</li>
</ul>

        <h3><a href="/bookreview/2018/08/20/ellenberg-math.html">How Not to be Wrong &#58; The Power of Mathematical Thinking</a> by Jordan Ellenberg</h3>
        <p><p>Why should I study math? When will I ever use it? What lessons can the work of mathematicians across the  millenia have for every person in the 21st century? These are the questions that Professor Ellenberg tackles in his phenomenal book. I asked the first two questions rather frequently as a child. I even asked those during my undergraduate and graduate studies! It is natural to ask such questions given that much of modern mathematics seemingly bears little on the natural world. A valid critique of the “unreasonable effectiveness” of mathematics mimics that of “Higher Order Truths About Chmess” by Daniel Dennett. Here are some answers.</p>

    <h1>Mathematics for Everyday Life</h1>
<h2>A Review of How Not to be Wrong &#58; The Power of Mathematical Thinking by Jordan Ellenberg</h2>

<p>Why should I study math? When will I ever use it? What lessons can the work of mathematicians across the  millenia have for every person in the 21st century? These are the questions that Professor Ellenberg tackles in his phenomenal book. I asked the first two questions rather frequently as a child. I even asked those during my undergraduate and graduate studies! It is natural to ask such questions given that much of modern mathematics seemingly bears little on the natural world. A valid critique of the “unreasonable effectiveness” of mathematics mimics that of “Higher Order Truths About Chmess” by Daniel Dennett. Here are some answers.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Abstract problems are excellent cross training. Solving such problems sharpens one’s thinking and prepares the mathematical community for more applied problems.</li>
  <li>Some problems are much easier to solve at a higher level of analysis.</li>
  <li>Rather than solve individual problems, it is much more efficent to solve a <em>class</em> of problems.</li>
  <li>Solving hard problems, regardless of immediate utility, is fun! There are few feelings that can match that of an epiphany after hours, days, or even years of struggle.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a mathematician, certain parts of this book seemed obvious when I first read them. For example, of course most important phenomena do not depend linearly on their determinants. Simple regression analyses have important limitations. It needs very little justification that “mathematical expectation” does not refer to the result that one should expect to occur in an average case. These truisms became apparent to me through courses in econometrics, probability, and common sense. However, it is always useful to remember that none of these statements are actually trivial. Their justifications each took a tremendous amount of effort by mathematicians (and those in related fields) to understand deeply. This book tells many of those stories. The intelligencia of yestyear was wrong about many things. But the nature of their errors are educational and sometimes teach more than refined arguments and</p>

<p>During many of my mathematics classes in high school, undergraduate school, and even graduate school, I solved problems and nurtured ways of thinking as if the ideas existed in some alternate reality analagous to Paul Erdos’ conceptualization of “God’s book.” Understanding the stories of these ideas helps to humanize them and contextualize them in everyday life.</p>

<h3 id="criticism"><strong>Criticism</strong></h3>

<p>A second minor critique proceeds as follows. The book seems poorly titled. A better subtitle may be something of the sort <em>The Power of <strong>Statistical</strong> Thinking</em> given that most of the book focuses on lessons of probability and statistics. Professor Ellenberg addresses this by noting that statistics grew out of mathematics and that ideas of probability manifest themselves in many branches of math. Nonetheles,</p>

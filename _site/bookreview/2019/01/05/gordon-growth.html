    <h1>An Anthology of the American Golden Age</h1>
<h2>A Review of The Rise and Fall of American Growth by Robert Gordon</h2>

<p>Most high school U.S. history courses focus on what I consider to be the dullest aspects of the subject. While an understanding of major political forces, wars, and social movements is invaluable in understanding the American story, focusing on these aspects can send the message that history is driven by individuals, rather than institutions that while certainly constructed by individuals, operate as forms of distributed intelligence. An equally valid lens through which one can (and should) understand American history is as a march of of science and technology that shape the lives of individuals via markets. Focusing on a period of American history that is approachable and relavent illustrates this utility of this perspective. This book synthesizes Professor Gordon’s research throughout much of his career, starting from his time in graduate school and the thoroughness sings off of the pages.</p>

<p>Ultimately the book argues the following: The period between 1870–1970 was the golden age of American growth and featured an unprecedented improvement in the standard of living for the vast majority of Americans. While the 21st century will certainly contain its fair share of “general purpose” technologies that will be transformative in their own ways, the growth and accompanied improvements in the standard of living will not match those of the previous century. To claim that the following century will be as revolutionary as the previous, one must argue that new technologies (i.e. AI, renewable energy, self driving cars, quantum computing, etc.) will be as important in the every day lives of Americans as was the advent of running water, refrigeration, and electricity. Indeed this is a highly nontrivial argumentative burden. Most of the book focuses on explaining the effect of growth on everyday life. This includes changes in diet, work life, entertainment, communication, transportation, and health. I enjoy this approach to American history because it puts me in the shoes of individuals and offers a much more vivid understanding of the relavent time period than political and military history.</p>

<p>There is nothing particularly special about these years. Rather, the trends that Gordon describes are continuous, mostly indifferent to political/cultural events, and 
The claim that 1870–1970 was the golden age of growth is a relatively straightforward proposition, but has certain complications. Namely, the U.S. government only started recording GDP in the 1930’s and the metric was changed many times in the following decades to better reflect total productivity in the economy. TODO: Include a brief discussion of some of the interesting sources.</p>

<p>I claim that GDP has become much less tied to the standard of living than it was in the early 1900s and that improvements in standard of living in the developed world will be almost entirely decoupled from GDP growth in the 21st century, but that is a more subtle argument for another day.</p>

<p>For argument’s sake, I will grant his premise that GDP gr</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GDP $\neq$ Standard of Living</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A central premise of the book undermines its thesis. In particular, GDP</p>

<h2 id="main-takeaways">Main Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
  <li>It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the anomalous growth in the 1870-1970 period. Based on estimates by Angus Maddison,
    <blockquote>
      <p>“The annual rate of growth in the Western world from AD 1 to AD 1820 was a mere 0.06 percent per year, or 6 percent per century” (Gordon 3).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If that does not blow your mind, then you did not read that correctly. It would take about 1000 years for annual production to double, which means that an individual living in almost any time in human history (a time period encompassing ~98% of the human age) could reasonably expect her standard of living to be approximately equal to that of her (great great great) grandparents and her (great great great) grandchildren.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Even if this is true, I do not find it to matter so much. Gordon’s argument has come a long way since this working paper in 2012 which featured this hilarious “social science”</li>
  <li>Most of the headwinds that Professor Gordon identifies are indeed substantial.</li>
  <li>This may be the most important takeaway.</li>
  <li>Moreover, there is no obvious answer. Indeed, in his review of this book, Paul Krugman answers Gordon’s question with a “definite maybe,” which I claim is the only intelligent answer.</li>
</ol>

<p>When starting a chapter, I recommend going straight to the tables/graphs in the chapter and spending a few minutes reading the relavent figures and sources. I enjoyed figured out the major patterns and guessing</p>

<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>

<p>I found some aspects of the book to be unnecessarily quantitative. An concept such as “standard of living” is inherintly subjective and while I sympathizes with the attempted rigor, the book would have been better off if it relegated GDP per capita, and especially TFP, to a lesser role. Why reduce a concept as interesting and multifacted as standard of living to 2-3 numbers? I could make the critique that TFP is a rather atheoretical and ill-defined but my main issue with it is that even at its best, TFP depends on so many parameters,</p>

<p>Moreover, if Gordon wants to “adjust” these measures to include nonmarket factors, then he has to give th</p>

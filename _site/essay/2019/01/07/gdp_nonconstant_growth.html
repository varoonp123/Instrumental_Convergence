    <h1>A Case Against Constant Economic Growth</h1>

<p>There seems to be a consensus among politicians, economists, and political scientists that a constant rate of economic growth is necessary to satisfy the (American) population and ensure political stability. “It’s the economy, stupid,” as President Clinton espoused. During every presidential election, candidates frequently set goals to expand the GDP by x percent. Markets go in a frenzy when China’s GDP growth rate falls from 12% in the early 2000s to a <em>measly</em> 6.5% today. This sentiment ignores the history of economic growth, its fundamental purpose, and creates a society that is dependent on materialism.</p>

<p>First, we need a bit of a mathematical background. A constant rate of growth of GDP (or any numerical quantity, for that matter) is one way of defining <strong>exponential growth</strong>. Any student who takes an introductory course in differential equation will invariably see an equation resembling the following: $\frac{dy}{dt} = ky$. For our purposes, we consider the case where $k &gt; 0$. This means that the rate of change in $y$ or the GDP will grow as the GDP itself grows. In other words, the GDP accelerates. The only solutions to this equation are of the form $y = Ce^{kt}$ where $C$ depends on an initial condition for $y$. That this solves the differential equation is clear from plugging it in. Uniqueness follows from the Contraction Mapping Theorem. This leads to the fact that <strong>constant growth in GDP means that the GDP grows exponentially</strong>. This should raise a red flag because exponential growth is always unsustainable, usually undesirable, and sometimes catastrophic.</p>

<p>Consider the following graph of the global GDP since 0 AD. <img src="/assets/images/gdp.svg" alt="A &quot;hockey stick&quot; graph of global GDP" /></p>

<p>It is quite remarkable. Pause here for atleast 30 minutes to take that in.</p>

<p>Here is a fact to consider when looking at this image:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The annual rate of growth in the Western world from AD 1 to AD 1820 was a mere 0.06 percent per year, or 6 percent per century” (Gordon 3).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice how flat this curve is for about 1800 years. The effects of the American and European industrializations, economic miracles of the BRICS (namely China), and rapid diversification of labor facilitated an explosion of industrial, creative, and technological output.</p>

<p>Anyone who is surprised by the above graph, however, does not know the first thing about economic growth. Thus we conclude: the transformations of the past 200 years are abnormal in the context of human history.</p>

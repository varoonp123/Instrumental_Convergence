    <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I am Varoon Pazhyanur, a programmer at _____. I graduated in Spring 2019 with an M.S./B.S. in Mathematics from <a href="https://math.emory.edu/home/">Emory University</a>. My thesis focussed on the realizability and inscribability of 4-polytopes and was advised by <a href="https://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~davidb/">David Borthwick</a>. You can find my CV <a href="/assets/cv.pdf">here</a>, but enough with the self-promotion.</p>

<p>For those who are curious, my first name (traditionally spelled “Varun”) refers to a Hindu and Jain god of water, while my surname refers to a region in India. I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagan,_Minnesota">Eagan, Minnesota</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite TV shows include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama">Futurama</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty">Rick and Morty</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)">The Office</a>, and</p>

<p>My favorite movies include The Matrix (only the first movie and the Architect scene from Reloaded), Dead Snow, the Harold and Kumar series, and</p>

<p>My favorite musicians include the Pat Metheny Group, Radiohead, Gustav Mahler, and Dmitri Shostakovich.</p>

<p>My favorite musicals include Wicked, In the Heights, and Legally Blonde (specifically, the 2009 West End production).</p>

<p>Those looking to buy my (nonexistent) influence can do so over a good mojito, vodka cranberry (light on the cranberry), cabernet sauvignon, riesling, or pinot grigio.</p>

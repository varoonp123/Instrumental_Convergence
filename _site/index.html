<p>This is the personal website of Varoon Pazhyanur. Here, you will find some of my musings on math (which I consider to be my primary Sisyphian endeavor), reviews of books that I find important, and any other thoughts that I care to develop. I will graduate in Spring 2019 with an M.S./B.S. in Mathematics from <a href="https://math.emory.edu/home/">Emory University</a>. My thesis focusses on the realizability and inscribability of 4-polytopes and is advised by <a href="https://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~davidb/">David Borthwick</a>. You can find my CV <a href="/assets/cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>I stole the name <em>Instrumental Convergence</em> from the AI literature. A convergent instrumental goal is a goal that is a useful stepping stone to many broader objectives. For example, one may claim that an intelligent system has implicit goals such as self-preservation, goal preservation, and resource acculumation. I find the idea to be extremely elegant and useful tool for framing decision making. Despite its power, this phenomenon has its fair share of pitfalls.</p>

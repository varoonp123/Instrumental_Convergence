<p>
  This page contains a series of essays that I have written primarily to refine my own thoughts and force myself to evaluate them more critically. All of these should be considered as drafts, and are subject to change as my own thoughts do so.

            <h3><a href="/essay/2019/01/07/gdp_nonconstant_growth.html">A Case Against Constant Economic Growth</a> </h3>
            <p><p>There seems to be a consensus among politicians, economists, and political scientists that a constant rate of economic growth is necessary to satisfy the (American) population and ensure political stability. “It’s the economy, stupid,” as President Clinton espoused. During every presidential election, candidates frequently set goals to expand the GDP by x percent. Markets go in a frenzy when China’s GDP growth rate falls from 12% in the early 2000s to a <em>measly</em> 6.5% today. This sentiment ignores the history of economic growth, its fundamental purpose, and creates a society that is dependent on materialism.</p>

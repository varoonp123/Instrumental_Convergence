        <h3>Computing The Convex Hull in $\mathbb{R}^2$</h3>
        <p><p>There are many classical algorithms to compute the convex hull of a finite point set in the plane, but I chose to implement three. Jarvis Matching involves iteratively adding points to the hull as to mimimize a turning angle. It runs in $O(nh)$ where $h$ is the number of points in the hull. The <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/72_10_convex_hull.pdf">Graham scan</a> iterates through groupings of three points naturally induced by modified polar coordinates, allowing it to reduce to two simple cases. Ronald Grahamâ€™s algorithm runs in $O(n \log(n))$. I created these <a href="/assets/jarvismatch.py">Python implementations</a> from the original papers.</p>

        <h3>The (Linear Sum) Assignment Problem</h3>
        <p><p>Consider the problem of placing $n$ individuals into $n$ jobs given a matrix $(a_{ij})$ of the rating of individual $i$ at job $j$. The problem is to find an efficient construction of the optimal assignment. In other words, for any square matrix, pick a sum-maximizing(or minimizing) set of elements that do no share a row or column. In the case where the cost marix is binary, this algorithm also solves the problem of picking a maximal set of nonattacking rooks given such an arrangement on a chess board. I created a <a href="/assets/munkres_assignment_algo.py">Python implementation</a> of the <em>Hungarian Algorithm</em> or the <em>Kuhn-Munkres Algorthm</em> from a <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/848c/717ba51e48afef714dfef4bd6ab1cc050dab.pdf">paper</a> by James Munkres. These types of problems were the subject of the 1975 Nobel Prize in Economics won by Leonid Kantorovich and Tjalling Koopmans.</p>

<h1>Other Projects</h1>

  <p>
    The following are projects that usually took a weekend or so. The code is fairly cringey, but one has to start somewhere.

        <h3>Twich Plays Battle Bots</h3>
        <p><p>Inspired by the surprisingly interesting social experiment known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon">Twitch Plays Pokemon</a>, we made Twitch chat-controlled cars that could play two games. Throw in some computer vision, Arduino, etc. and you get this monstrosity. <a href="https://github.com/cdsupina/MHacks2016">Github repo</a>. My hackathon projects are on <a href="https://devpost.com/pazhyanurv?ref_content=user-portfolio&amp;ref_feature=portfolio&amp;ref_medium=global-nav">Devpost</a>.</p>

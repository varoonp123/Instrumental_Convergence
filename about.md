# About Me
I am Varoon Pazhyanur, a programmer at _____. I graduated in Spring 2019 with an M.S./B.S. in Mathematics from [Emory University](https://math.emory.edu/home/). My thesis focussed on the realizability and inscribability of 4-polytopes and was advised by [David Borthwick](https://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~davidb/). You can find my CV [here](/assets/cv.pdf), but enough with the self-promotion. 

For those who are curious, my first name (traditionally spelled "Varun") refers to a Hindu and Jain god of water, while my surname refers to a region in India. I was born and raised in [Eagan, Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagan,_Minnesota). 

My favorite TV shows include [Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama), [Rick and Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty), [The Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)), and 

My favorite movies include The Matrix (only the first movie and the Architect scene from Reloaded), Dead Snow, the Harold and Kumar series, and 

My favorite musicians include the Pat Metheny Group, Radiohead, Gustav Mahler, and Dmitri Shostakovich. 

My favorite musicals include Wicked, In the Heights, and Legally Blonde (specifically, the 2009 West End production). 

Those looking to buy my (nonexistent) influence can do so over a good mojito, vodka cranberry (light on the cranberry), cabernet sauvignon, riesling, or pinot grigio.

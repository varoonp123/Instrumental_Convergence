# Expository Papers


This page contains a series of papers that I have written for the purpose of furthering my own understanding, and that of anyone who cares to read them. The inspiration to do this work stems from the fantastic and helpful papers by [Keith Conrad](http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/). I especially recommend his papers on group theory and analysis. For those looking for entertaining reads, I recommend his [paper](http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/analysis/irrational.pdf) on the irrationality of numbers of the form $\pi^q$ and $e^q$ where $q$ is rational. **This section of the site is still under construction and will be ready in mid to late June.**

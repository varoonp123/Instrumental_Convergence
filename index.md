# Welcome to Instrumental Convergence!

This is the personal blog of Varoon Pazhyanur. You will find some of my musings on math (which I consider to be my primary Sisyphian endeavor in the sense of Camus), reviews of books that I find important, and any other thoughts that I care to develop.

I stole the name _Instrumental Convergence_ from the AI literature. A convergent instrumental goal is a goal that is a useful stepping stone to many broader objectives. For example, one may claim that an intelligent system has implicit goals such as self-preservation, goal preservation, and resource acculumation.
